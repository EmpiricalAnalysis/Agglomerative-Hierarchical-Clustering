# Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

This is a project I completed while taking "MITx: 6.00.2x Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science" on Edx. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice writing an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. The algorithm is then used to cluster cities across the United States according to information available about each.


The python codes I wrote are in clusterCities.py .
